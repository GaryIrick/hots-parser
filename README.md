# hots-parser

A node-based Heroes of the Storm parser.

## Why this fork?

This repo was forked from the original to use heroprotocol from https://github.com/garyirick/heroprotocol.  That version
will automatically fall back on the latest version if the current version of the protocol has not yet been published by Blizzard.

## Setup

### From npm

`npm add hots-parser`

### From Repository

```
git clone
cd hots-parser
npm install
```

## Updating the Parser

`hots-parser` relies on [heroprotocol.js](https://github.com/garyirick/heroprotocol) to access the StormReplay files.
These files are pulled directly from the Blizzard [heroprotocol](https://github.com/blizzard/heroprotocol) repository.
If you're running this on a server, you will need to monitor the Blizzard repository and run `node node_modules/heroprotocol/postinstall.js`
to keep the parser up to date.

Note that `hots-parser` will throw an `unverifiedBuild` error if I have not personally verified
that the new build works correctly with the parser. You'll have to also monitor this module for updates to
keep everything updated. It might be best to run `postinstall.js` after updating this module just to be safe.

## Usage

```
const Parser = require('hots-parser')
```

### processReplay()

`Parser.processReplay(file, options = {})`

Main replay processing function.

**Arguments**

`file` - String containing the path to the replay file.

`options` - Optional object that can contain the following:

- `getBMData` : bool, default `true`. Set to false to skip parsing all
taunts, b-step, spray, and dance events. These options use the `gamedata` archive, which adds
significant processing time as the parser loads and inspects all game events.
- `useAttributeName` : bool, default `false`. Set to true to leave hero names unresolved
and use the internal attribute code instead.
Hero names are stored in the `attr.js` file, and will lag behind patches by approximately one day.
If you'd like to not worry about new heroes causing problems, you will want to set this to true.
- `overrideVerifiedBuild` : bool, default `false`. Set to true to override the parser's default verification step.
This step aborts parsing if the given replay file is too new (on an unverified build).
It is recommended to wait until the parser is updated before running any parsing operations in order to
account for unexpected or large changes to the replay file format. This setting bypasses this check, and
should be run at your own risk.
- `legacyTalentKeys` : bool, default `false`. Prior to version 7, the talents were stored using keys
that contained spaces (`Tier 1 Choice`). The spaces have been removed by default in version 7+ (`Tier1Choice`).
If you are using an application that
requires the old keys for legacy compatibility reasons, set this option to true.

**Returns**

JSON object containing `result`, `match`, and `players` keys.

`result` integer status code indicating success or failure. You want to see a `1` here.
See `Parser.ReplayStatus` for possible values of this field.

`match` contains information about the parsed match. It gathers team-specific data, and can be linked
back to players via the player's ToonHandles.

`players` contains 10 objects. Each object is keyed by the player's ToonHandle (unique identifier).
These objects contain player-specific statistics.

The best way to see the results of these files is to run the parser and inspect the output yourself.

**Notes**

This parser does not allow AI games to be parsed and will throw an error if this occurs.

### ReplayStatus

`Parser.ReplayStatus`

**Values**

* `OK = 1`
* `Unsupported = 0`
* `Duplicate = -1` - This is a holdover from when the parser was part of Stats of the Storm
* `Failure = -2` - If you get this exception and it's not about a missing filepath, please report it. This indicates a general internal exception that should probably be fixed.
* `UnsupportedMap = -3` - Brawls are included in unsupported maps.
* `ComputerPlayerFound = -4` - AI games will not parse.
* `Incomplete = -5` - Partial replay detected. If the parser does not see a core destroyed it will be unable to find a winner and this status will be returned.
* `TooOld = -6` - Related to Incomplete. Usually returned if a winner is unable to be determined from some very old replays, or some recent incomplete replays.

**Notes**

Values from this enum can be resolved into strings by passing it into `Parser.StatusString[]` (which is an object)

### parse()

`Parser.parse(filename, requestedData[], opts)`

Extract specific replay data. Data is returned unprocessed.

**Arguments**

`filename` - the path to the replay file

`requestedData` - Array containing keys specifying which data to get. Available values are in `Parser.ReplayDataType`.
You can also use shortcuts `Parser.CommonReplayData` (all data except game events) and `Parser.AllReplayData`
as arguments.

`options` - object containing the following possible values:

* `saveToFile` : string, doesn't exist by default. If this key is present, the replay data will also be
written to the specified file.

**Returns**

Object containing the specified replay data. Object keys are values in `Parser.ReplayDataType`.

### ReplayDataType

`Parser.ReplayDataType`

Values in this enum correspond with flags given to the reference Blizzard/heroprotocol implementation.

**Values**

* `game = "gameevents"`
* `message = "messageevents"`
* `tracker = "trackerevents`
* `attribute = "attributeevents"`
* `header = "header"`
* `details = "details"`
* `init = "initdata"`
* `stats = "stats"`

### getHeader()

`Parser.getHeader(file)`

Returns basic information about the match.

**Arguments**

`file` - path to the replay file

**Returns**

Object containing basic match data. Includes match version, date, players info (including ToonHandles),
map, and game mode.
